# Discourse

A Discord bot framework that provides a different approach to defining commands. This is purely for old text based bots, not `/` command driven bots, sorry. 

Closures? Closures.

### Note
Not built for real bots. Just for fun and learning opportunities. Uses discord.js under the hood.
test coverage soon :tm:
